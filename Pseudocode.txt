START

1. SETUP HTML structure:
    - Define <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>
    - Add meta tags for charset and viewport
    - Title: "Music Player"

2. STYLE with CSS:
    - Body: gradient background, flex center alignment, full height
    - Player container: white background, rounded corners, shadow, centered
    - Header: flex layout, space-between, icon buttons
    - Cover image: circle, fixed size
    - Song title & artist name: styled text
    - Controls: flex layout, buttons for prev/play/next
    - Progress bar: styled input range

3. HTML content:
    - Player container:
        - Header with "back" and "menu" buttons
        - Cover image with fallback
        - Song title: "Lover"
        - Artist name: "Diljit Dosanjh"
        - Progress bar (range input)
        - Control buttons: prev, play/pause, next
        - Audio element (hidden)

4. JAVASCRIPT logic:
    - GET elements: audio, play button, progress bar
    - ADD event listener to "play" button:
        IF audio is paused:
            - Play audio
            - Change button to "pause" icon
        ELSE:
            - Pause audio
            - Change button to "play" icon
    - ADD event listener to audio "timeupdate":
        - Calculate progress = (currentTime / duration) * 100
        - Set progress bar value
    - ADD event listener to progress bar "input":
        - Calculate seekTime = (progress value / 100) * audio duration
        - Set audio currentTime to seekTime
